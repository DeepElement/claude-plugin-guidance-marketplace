description: Validate that a plugin claiming to be a "Concept" plugin correctly follows the concept/realization architecture (tier 1 concept, tier 2 realization contract, tier 3 realizations, default realization, activation-check invocation), validate a workspace-authored realization skill against a concept's published contract, check that concepts reference each other only by name, and detect when a concept plugin has drifted into needing more than one realization contract and should be split into sibling concepts. Use proactively whenever the user is authoring or editing a plugin under plugins/*/skills/concept/, plugins/*/skills/realization-contract/, or plugins/*/skills/realize-*/, whenever a consuming workspace is authoring its own realization skill for a marketplace concept, or whenever the user explicitly asks to check/validate/audit a concept plugin, a workspace realization, cross-concept references, or whether a plugin should be split.

# Validate Concept Plugin

Checks marketplace concept plugins, and workspace-authored realizations of
them, against the concept/realization architecture described in
[docs/architecture.md](../../../../docs/architecture.md). Read that document
first if you haven't already — this skill enforces it, it doesn't restate
it.

This skill only applies to plugins/skills that opt into the pattern. It
does not apply to plain, single-tier plugins, and should never demand that
a plugin adopt this structure — only that a plugin or realization which
*has* adopted it (see "How to detect a Concept plugin" below) does so
correctly.

This skill covers three distinct checks, run independently depending on
what's being authored or what the user asks for:

- **A. Marketplace concept plugin structure** — checks 1–9 below, for a
  concept plugin living in this marketplace's own `plugins/` tree.
- **B. A workspace-authored realization** — see "Validating a
  workspace-authored realization" below, for a realization skill living
  outside this marketplace (e.g. in a consuming workspace's own
  `.claude/skills/`) that claims to satisfy a marketplace concept's
  contract.
- **C. Cross-concept reference discipline** — see "Cross-concept
  reference check" below, scanning any concept's Tier 1 skill for leaked
  coupling to a specific realization.
- **D. Split-signal check** — check 10 below, detecting when a concept
  plugin has outgrown the one-contract-per-concept rule and should be
  split into sibling concepts instead of accommodating a second contract
  shape in place.

## How to detect a Concept plugin

A plugin is a Concept plugin if it has a
`skills/concept/SKILL.md` file. Presence of that file is the sole
signal — no `plugin.json` field is required to opt in, and neither is
having any realization-contract or realization yet (see check 4: a
Concept plugin may legitimately have `skills/concept/` and nothing
else). If a plugin has `skills/realization-contract/` or
`skills/realize-*/` but no `skills/concept/`, flag that on its own (see
check 1) rather than assuming intent.

If a plugin has none of `skills/concept/`, `skills/realization-contract/`,
or `skills/realize-*/`, it's a plain plugin — skip all checks below and
say so.

## Checks (A: marketplace concept plugin structure)

For each Concept plugin found (or the one specified by the user):

1. **Tier 1 present and abstract.** `skills/concept/SKILL.md` exists and
   its content describes the capability without naming a specific
   provider/vendor/technology in the body (a provider name appearing only
   as a passing example is fine; the operations/description should not
   assume one specific provider's API or behavior). Flag any tier 1 file
   that reads like documentation for one particular provider. Also check,
   non-blocking:
   - the operations a realization must support are enumerated as a
     short list (verb, inputs, outputs) rather than buried in prose
   - failure modes are named in the abstract (e.g. "not found," "not
     authorized") rather than as one provider's actual error names/codes

2. **Tier 2 present and is a contract, not an implementation** (only
   required once the plugin has ≥1 realization — see check 4).
   `skills/realization-contract/SKILL.md` exists and defines the
   operations/interface a realization implements and the identifying
   name convention a realization registers under. Flag if this file
   contains actual working implementation logic rather than a
   schema/contract definition — that content belongs in a tier 3
   realization.

3. **Tier 2 `schema.json` present and valid.**
   `skills/realization-contract/schema.json` exists, parses as valid
   JSON Schema, and includes a `contractVersion` field (blocking if
   missing entirely; non-blocking if present but missing
   `contractVersion`). Per the
   [`schema.json` convention](../../../../docs/architecture.md#the-schemajson-convention-tier-2-and-tier-3),
   this should stay minimal — flag (non-blocking) any field that looks
   provider-specific rather than something every realization would need.
   Also flag (non-blocking) if `skills/realization-contract/SKILL.md`
   contains no example `config` block satisfying the base schema — this
   is what a workspace author writing their own realization copies as a
   starting point.

4. **Realization count determines which checks below apply.** Count
   `skills/realize-<provider>/SKILL.md` directories.
   - **Zero realizations, and no `skills/realization-contract/` either:**
     this is a concept-only plugin (architecture.md §4) — a legitimate,
     permanent-or-transitional end state, not a failure. Report it as
     such (see "Reporting" below) and skip checks 2, 5, 6, 7 and the
     realization-contract half of check 3 entirely; only check 1 (Tier 1)
     applies.
   - **Zero realizations, but `skills/realization-contract/` exists:**
     a contract with nothing yet implementing it. This is unusual —
     per §4 a contract is only expected to exist once a first
     realization is being added — so flag it (non-blocking) as worth
     checking whether the contract was published prematurely, but still
     run checks 2–3 against it. Skip checks 5–7 (nothing to check them
     against).
   - **One or more realizations exist:** run all checks 2–9 as normal;
     `skills/realization-contract/` is now required (blocking if
     missing, per check 2).

5. **Exactly one default realization (only if ≥1 realization exists).**
   Among all `skills/realize-*/` directories, exactly one is marked as
   the default (per whatever marker the contract specifies, e.g.
   `default: true` in frontmatter or an explicit statement in the
   realization's SKILL.md). Flag if zero are marked default (workspace
   has no out-of-the-box option) or if more than one claims to be
   default (ambiguous). Not applicable to a concept-only plugin — there
   is nothing to default to.

6. **Every realization publishes a valid, superset `schema.json`.** Each
   `skills/realize-<provider>/schema.json` exists, parses as valid JSON
   Schema, and is a superset of tier 2's `schema.json` — every field
   `required` in tier 2 is still `required` here (never dropped or
   loosened), and field types/meanings aren't changed. Missing entirely
   is blocking; present but not a valid superset (e.g. narrows or drops
   a required field) is also blocking, since it silently breaks the
   contract tier 2 promises. Also check, non-blocking:
   - every property has a `description`
   - optional fields have a `default` where a sensible one exists
   - the realization's own default status (§4 of the architecture doc)
     is stated in its SKILL.md, not only in the concept skill

7. **Realization naming matches provider, not concept.** Flag
   (non-blocking) any `skills/realize-<provider>/` whose name is generic
   or repeats the concept name (e.g. `realize-default`) rather than
   naming the actual provider/technology it implements.

8. **Every realization invokes the activation check first.** Each
   realization's SKILL.md instructs Claude to run the activation check
   (from `guidance-activation-check`, if installed) before doing any real
   work, so missing/stale workspace configuration is caught with a clear
   message rather than failing inside the realization. Flag (blocking)
   any realization missing this step entirely; flag (non-blocking) one
   where the invocation is present but not the literal first instruction
   (e.g. operational steps precede it). If `guidance-activation-check`
   isn't installed in this marketplace yet, note that as a separate,
   marketplace-level gap rather than failing every realization
   individually.

9. **Naming consistency.** The realization identifying names used in each
   `skills/realize-*/SKILL.md` are unique within the plugin and match
   what tier 2 says the naming convention should be (e.g. matching the
   directory name minus the `realize-` prefix).

10. **Split-signal check (§8 of the architecture doc): does this plugin
    actually hold two concepts?** This is a judgment call, not a hard
    rule — always report findings here as "consider splitting," never as
    a failure, and always show the evidence so the user can decide.
    Look for these structural proxies of drift:
    - **Branching language in Tier 1.** `skills/concept/SKILL.md`
      contains conditional phrasing keyed on realization type or
      provider category (e.g. "if using a chat-style realization... if
      using an email-style realization...", "for X-type providers... for
      Y-type providers..."). This is the clearest tell — Tier 1 should
      describe one uniform set of operations, not branch on how a
      realization implements them.
    - **Low schema overlap across realizations.** Compare the
      `properties` keys across all `skills/realize-*/schema.json` files
      for this concept. If they share little beyond what tier 2's base
      schema already requires — i.e. most of what makes each realization
      "work" is realization-specific, not concept-shared — that's
      evidence the concept's single contract is straining to cover two
      different shapes of capability.
    - **Tier 2 itself branches.** `skills/realization-contract/SKILL.md`
      or its `schema.json` describes alternate/optional groups of
      required fields depending on realization "type" (e.g. a
      discriminated union, an `if/then` in the JSON Schema, or prose like
      "chat realizations must also provide... email realizations must
      also provide..."). A single contract needing internal branching to
      describe its own realizations is the same drift as Tier 1
      branching, one layer down.
    When any of these appear, report it as: what was found (with the
    quoted text or field list), why it suggests two concepts, and the
    suggested split — a name for each resulting sibling concept and a
    note that the original plugin's Tier 1 should reference the new
    sibling(s) by name (per §5) rather than absorbing their contract.

## Validating a workspace-authored realization (B)

Per §2 of the architecture doc, a consuming workspace can author its own
realization for a marketplace concept (e.g. in `.claude/skills/` outside
this marketplace) instead of using a marketplace-shipped one. Use this
check when the user is authoring such a skill, or asks to validate one.

1. **Identify the target concept.** The workspace realization's SKILL.md
   must declare which concept and contract version it satisfies (per §1
   Tier 3 requirements). If it doesn't say, ask the user which marketplace
   concept plugin it's meant to realize — do not guess.

2. **Locate that concept's contract.** Find the concept plugin's
   `skills/realization-contract/schema.json` and `SKILL.md` (in this
   marketplace, or wherever the concept plugin is installed). If the
   concept plugin isn't available to inspect, report that this check
   can't complete and say what's needed (the concept plugin installed or
   its contract files provided).

3. **Run the same checks as Tier 3 realizations in set A**, applied to
   this workspace skill instead of a `skills/realize-<provider>/`
   directory:
   - it publishes its own `schema.json` (blocking if missing)
   - that `schema.json` is a valid superset of the concept's tier 2
     `schema.json` (blocking if it drops/narrows a required field)
   - every property has a `description` (non-blocking)
   - it invokes the activation check as its first instruction
     (non-blocking if present-but-not-first, blocking if entirely absent)
   - its declared identifying name doesn't collide with an existing
     marketplace-shipped realization's name for the same concept unless
     it's intentionally meant to override/replace it (ask the user if
     unclear)

4. **It does not need**: a matching directory name convention, a
   `default: true` marker (workspace realizations are opted into via
   `marketplace-plugin-settings.yml`'s `realization:` field, never as an
   implicit default), or to live under any particular path — those A-set
   rules are about this marketplace's own shipped plugins specifically.

Report the same way as set A: blocking vs. non-blocking, file and fix
suggestion per finding.

## Cross-concept reference check (C)

Per §5 of the architecture doc, one concept's instructions may reference
another concept by name only — never a specific realization, and never
assuming one is active. Use this check when reviewing any concept
plugin's Tier 1 (`skills/concept/SKILL.md`) or Tier 3
(`skills/realize-*/SKILL.md`) content that mentions another concept, or
when the user asks to audit cross-concept coupling across the
marketplace (or a subset of it).

1. **Scan for other concepts' realization names.** For each concept
   plugin found, collect the full set of realization identifying names
   registered by every *other* installed concept plugin (from their
   `skills/realize-*/SKILL.md` files).

2. **Check for leaked references.** Search this concept's `skills/concept/`
   and `skills/realize-*/` files for any of those other concepts'
   realization names appearing in the instruction text. A reference to
   another concept by its **concept name** (e.g. "use the `secrets`
   concept") is correct and expected — flag only references to a
   specific *realization* of another concept (e.g. "use
   `aws-secrets-manager`" instead of "use the `secrets` concept").

3. **Check for hardcoded assumptions.** Flag (non-blocking) any
   instruction phrased as though a particular realization is always
   active for another concept (e.g. "since this uses AWS, assume the
   region config is set") rather than resolving it generically through
   that concept's own activation check.

This check is inherently best-effort text matching — report findings as
suggestions to review, not certainties, since natural-language text can
mention a provider name for reasons unrelated to a hard dependency (e.g.
a comparison in documentation). Always show the matched text so the user
can judge intent.

## Reporting

State which check set(s) ran (A, B, C, D, or a combination) before
listing findings, so the user knows what was and wasn't covered.

If check 4 found zero realizations and no `skills/realization-contract/`,
say so plainly and stop there for set A: *"This is a concept-only plugin
(0 realizations) — a valid, permanent-or-transitional state per
architecture.md §4. Only Tier 1 applies; checks 2, 5, 6, 7 and 3's
contract half don't apply here."* This is not a finding to fix — do not
list it under Blocking or Non-blocking.

Otherwise, group findings within each set as:

- **Blocking** — missing tier 1, missing tier 2 (when the plugin has
  ≥1 realization), missing or invalid tier 2 `schema.json`, a
  realization or workspace-authored skill missing `schema.json` or
  whose `schema.json` isn't a valid superset of tier 2's, zero or
  multiple default realizations among plugins that have ≥1 realization
  (set A only — not applicable to a workspace-authored realization or
  to a concept-only plugin), a realization/workspace skill missing the
  activation-check invocation entirely. These mean the plugin/skill
  cannot be used as documented, or silently breaks the contract, and
  should be fixed before merging/publishing/using it.
- **Non-blocking** — a `skills/realization-contract/` published with
  zero realizations yet to satisfy it, missing `contractVersion`,
  missing example config block, missing field descriptions/defaults,
  undocumented default status, generic realization naming, activation
  check present but not first, naming drift, un-enumerated operations
  or non-abstract failure modes in Tier 1, any set-C cross-concept
  reference finding, and any set-D split-signal finding (all always
  non-blocking — they're evidence-based judgment calls for the user to
  weigh, never certainties). These degrade the guarantees the
  architecture doc promises (clear config errors, swappability,
  self-explanatory config, loose coupling, one contract per concept)
  but don't make the plugin unusable outright.

For each finding, give the file and a one-line fix suggestion. Do not
silently modify files — report and let the user decide, unless they've
explicitly asked you to fix issues found.
