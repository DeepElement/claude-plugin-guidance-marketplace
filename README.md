# claude-plugin-guidance

Claude's default plugin guidance tells you the mechanics, not how to
design a plugin that extends well — this marketplace offers the
concept/realization pattern so a plugin realizes cleanly into real-world
variation.

## Why this exists

Anthropic's plugin/marketplace standard defines the mechanics — manifest
schema, directory layout, component types — but says nothing about how
to structure a marketplace repo well as you build it: what naming to
use, what docs are expected, how to shape a plugin whose capability has
more than one possible implementation. Without that layer, every
marketplace author either reinvents these conventions from scratch or
drifts into inconsistency one plugin at a time, and a mistake surfaces
only as a confusing failure downstream, far from the change that caused
it.

This marketplace is that missing layer. Install these plugins into your
marketplace repo and they'll guide you toward good structure as you
write it, and give you a clear, specific notice when something's off —
instead of leaving you to remember the rules yourself. It is **not** a
general-purpose plugin collection, and it's not meant to be installed
into an ordinary application workspace — it's for the person building
the marketplace repo itself (a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` plus a
`plugins/` directory), authored so its checks run *as you write*, not
after.

## The two plugins, together

Neither plugin here is more foundational than the other — install both.
**guidance-conventions** enforces the structure your marketplace repo
should have; **guidance-activation-check** is the runtime helper any
plugin built with that structure can call on to fail predictably instead
of confusingly.

- **[guidance-conventions](./plugins/guidance-conventions)** — checks
  your marketplace repo's naming, required docs, and structure as you
  author it, including a deeper check for any plugin that adopts the
  [concept/realization pattern](./docs/architecture.md) described below.
  This is where the marketplace-authoring rules live.

- **[guidance-activation-check](./plugins/guidance-activation-check)** —
  a shared pre-flight check your plugins can call before doing real
  work. It validates `marketplace-plugin-settings.yml` against the
  active realization's published config schema, so a missing or outdated
  configuration produces one clear, actionable message instead of a
  confusing failure deep in unrelated logic.

## Install

Run these from inside your marketplace project:

```
/plugin marketplace add DeepElement/claude-plugin-guidance-marketplace
/plugin install guidance-conventions@claude-plugin-guidance
/plugin install guidance-activation-check@claude-plugin-guidance
```

## The concept/realization pattern

If a plugin you're building represents a capability with more than one
possible implementation (e.g. secrets, notifications — something with
swappable providers), this marketplace recommends a specific pattern for
it: an abstract concept, a contract concrete providers must satisfy, one
or more provider realizations, and a single settings file where a
consumer picks and configures a provider.

Read **[How this marketplace works](./docs/architecture.md)** for the
full explanation and the detailed spec — this README stays intentionally
short.

## The base standard

This repo doesn't redefine the Claude Code plugin/marketplace standard
itself (directory layout, manifest schema, component types) — that's
owned by Anthropic and documented at:

- [Plugins reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference)
- [Create plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins)
- [Create and distribute a plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces)
